**GitHub Action to automate pull request reviews**

> **:warning: THIS ACTION IS DEPRECATED. YOU DO NOT NEED IT. :warning:**\
> **This action can be implemented in a single workflow using
> [`actions/checkout`][3] and the [GitHub CLI][4].**

```yaml
# Approve Pull Request
#
# Automatically approve a pull request when a review is requested from @flexdevelopment by certain users.
#
#

name: approve-pr
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - review_requested
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_ADMIN }}
jobs:
  approve-pr:
    if: github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'flexdevelopment'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: checkout
        name: Checkout ${{ github.head_ref }}
        uses: actions/checkout@v3.0.2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - id: approve
        name: Approve pull request
        if: github.actor == 'unicornware' || github.actor == 'quickbrownfox'
        run: gh pr review ${{ github.event.number }} --approve --body 'lgtm üëçüèæ'
```

**Note**: Setting `env.GITHUB_TOKEN` to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` will
result in the [`github-actions`][5] bot submitting reviews.

## Usage

Do you work alone? Do you request reviews from your admin account? Is switching
between accounts becoming a hassle? Geared towards lone developers, this action
speeds up your pull request workflow by allowing you to automate reviews.

```yaml
# Automate Pull Request Reviews - .github/workflows/flautoreview.yml
#
# References:
#
# - https://github.com/flex-development/flautoreview

---
name: Automate PR Reviews
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [review_requested]
jobs:
  flautoreview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: flexdevelopment
        uses: flex-development/flautoreview@v1.0.1
        with:
          body: lgtm üëçüèæ
          reviewers: flexdevelopment
          senders: unicornware
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_REPO_flexdevelopment }}
      - name: prbot
        uses: flex-development/flautoreview@v1.0.1
        with:
          body: lgtm2 üëçüèæ
          reviewers: prbot
          senders: unicornware
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_REPO_prbot }}
```

See: [`.github/workflows/flautoreview.yml`](.github/workflows/flautoreview.yml)

**Note**: Using `github.token`, the default `token` value, will result in the
[`github-actions`][5] bot submitting reviews instead of the user or team listed
in `reviewers`.
